## Getting Started üèÅ

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KristiyanHristov04/ReactMusicApp.git
cd ReactMusicApp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Supabase Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Database Setup
1. Disable Row Level Security (RLS) for the following tables:
   - `songs`
   - `artists`
   - `songs_artists`
   - `users_favourite_songs`

To disable RLS for each table:
1. Go to Authentication > Policies
2. Find each table
3. Click on "Enable RLS" to disable it (toggle should be grey)

### Storage Setup
1. Create a new bucket named `song-files`
2. Create the following folders inside the bucket:
   - `artist-images/`
   - `song-audios/`
   - `song-images/`

3. Add a storage policy to allow CRUD operations:
   - Go to Storage > Policies
   - Select the `song-files` bucket
   - Click "New Policy"
   - Choose "For full customization"
   - Allow all operations (CRUD)
   - Target roles choose "all"
   - Save the policy
   
   This will allow anyone to perform all operations (read, create, update, delete). For better security in production, you may want to create specific policies to restrict access based on user roles and authentication.
